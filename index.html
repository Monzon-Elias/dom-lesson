            <p>
                In this section, the entire layout was created using only javaScript. There is no stylesheet to reference. A Google-Fonts font was imported, zero margin was placed on the body. The thirteen sections will accommodate the thirteen topics that must be covered in the course. Each section has a background-image, creating a nice paralax effect.

            <p>Using two animations simultaneously, we put Fred to dance. Later I think adding an audio. Press the button to see/stop the dancing show. Through script, I was able to toggle two behaviors using the same button, even the button text.</p>

                Using the scale and rotate transforms properties and animations, along with other specific features related to the flipping card effect, I was able to bring to life an iconic movie phrase. <br>
                Here we see a sequence of flipping cards that brings us a famous and glorious phrase in three phases. In the end, we see the protagonist of the history giving us his best roar. Shrek's roar is nothing compared!

            <p>
                This section tells a little fun story that takes eleven seconds. I did this animated sequence of texts and images using setimeout() method as in the Transforms section. I created specific functions for the main actions in this program. One to create a text, one to create an emoticon, and one to replace elements.

                The Canvas Object is new in HTML5. Canvas is a container for graphics in which, through script, we can draw graphics. In this instance I've created an animated frame to frame movie of a horse galloping.<br> 
                The Video element is a new HTML 5 tag. It has many properties accessible by DOM. Here I have created a video element with basic controls and autoplay = true. <br>
                The Audio element is a new HTML 5 tag. It shares almost all the video tag properties. Here I have added an audio tag with basic controls, with no autoplay.
