                In this section, the entire layout was created using only javaScript. There is no stylesheet to reference. A Google-Fonts font was imported, zero margin was placed on the body. The thirteen sections will accommodate the thirteen topics that must be covered in the course. Each section has a background-image, creating a nice paralax effect.<br> <span id="sourceCode">Press</span> (Ctrl + U) to see the source code of the page.
